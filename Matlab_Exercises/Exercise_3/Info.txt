This exercise presents an example of the use of mPOD and POD on a 2D scalar dataset.
This dataset is constructed from the CFD simulation of the 2D Navier-stokes problem in the vorticity-stream function
formulation. The data has coherent and non coherent sources as well as a significant amount of random noise.
More info on the test case is presented in Sec. 5 of
