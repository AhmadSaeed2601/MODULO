This exercise presents an example of the use of mPOD and POD on a 2D scalar dataset.
This dataset is constructed by adding three modes of similar energy content, to challenge the POD.
These three modes have orthogonal spatial structures and 'almost orthogonal' temporal ones. 
Yet, the POD mixes them due to their similar energetic content
More info on the test case is presented in Sec. 4 of
