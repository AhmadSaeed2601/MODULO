This exercise presents an example of the use of mPOD and POD on a 1D scalar dataset.
This dataset is the velocity profile of a pulsating Poiseuille Flow. 
More info on the test case is presented in Mendez & Buchlin, TN215, available at:

The Pulsation is produced at two different frequencies, which corresponds to Womersley numbers of 0.1 and 0.2.
The first triggers a response which is almost in quasi-steady condition and hence preserves the parabolic shape of the profile.
The second triggers a more distorted response, which results in the excitation of many more eigenfunctions. 
In this exercise, the mPOD easily separates the two contributions, while the classical POD is incapable of achieving such distinction.
